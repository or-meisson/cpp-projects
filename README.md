# Ex 4: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Network

## Overview
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Network designed to process images and predict outcomes based on neural network principles. The network uses a series of dense layers with ReLU and softmax activation functions to make predictions.

## Features
- **Neural Network Prediction**: Uses a four-layer MLP for image classification.
- **Custom Matrix Library**: Includes a custom implementation for matrix operations essential for neural network computations such as matrix multiplication, addition, and activation functions.
- **Activation Functions**: Implements ReLU and softmax activation functions for neural processing.
- **Command Line Interface**: Provides a CLI for easy interaction with the network to predict image data.

# Ex5: Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This repository contains a C++ program that implements a movie recommendation system. The system utilizes user ratings and movie features to recommend movies based on content filtering and collaborative filtering techniques.

## Features
- **Content-Based Recommendation**: Suggests movies by analyzing the similarity of movie features.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Predicts user preferences based on similar user ratings.
- **Movie and User Management**: Allows for the addition of new movies and user ratings dynamically into the system.
- **Customizable Recommendations**: Offers recommendations based on content or collaborative approaches, adaptable to user preferences.
